Created during Design News Course Code Sharing, Collaboration and Version Control: An Hands-on Introduction to Git and GitHub by Charles Lord.  15Nov16
This respository contains steps that are explained in the next two presentations, 16-17 Nov16.

11/14 Intro to Version Control and Code Collaboration
11/15 Basic Git Concepts
11/16 GitHub Hands-On, Part 1
11/17 GitHub Hands-On, Part 2
11/18 Local Clients and Other Hosts

New findings for me (that were not necessarily in the presentation):
To delete a repository, open it, go to Settings, and at bottom of page select 'Delete this Repository'
To understand the difference between Fork and Branch, Google search GitHub fork vs. branch!
Use of Github.io webserver to create a web page.  Introduced in Day 4 of the Charles Lord's course.
